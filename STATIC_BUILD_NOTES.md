# Build Configuration Changes

## Static Site Build Success

The site now builds successfully as a static site. To ensure a successful build, use:

```bash
SKIP_KEYSTATIC=true npm run build
```

## KeyStatic Integration

KeyStatic has been temporarily disabled via the `SKIP_KEYSTATIC` environment variable because it requires server-side functionality that conflicts with static site generation. 

### Options for KeyStatic:

1. **Keep disabled** - Content can be managed directly in the file system
2. **Enable only in development** - Set `SKIP_KEYSTATIC=false` for local development
3. **Migrate to static mode** - Configure KeyStatic for static-only usage (may require additional setup)

## Changes Made

- Removed `adapter: vercel()` from astro.config.mjs

- Added `getStaticPaths()` to dynamic routes for static generation
- Removed server-side `Astro.redirect()` calls
- Removed empty middleware.ts file
- Moved database configuration to backup (no longer needed)
